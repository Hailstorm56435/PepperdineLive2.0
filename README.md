Pepperdine Live 2.0:

Project developed by Landon Brewster and Nick Landers
  Inspired by Pepperdine Live, developed by Hunter Martin

PepperdineLive is an application meant to guide lost people at Pepperdine University, by providing them detailed locational information, through a 3d map which includes pepperdine buildings, their rooms, and any aliases. Pepperidne Live integrates with live pepperdine events, and can direct the user to event locations.

Future improvements include:
  Optimization
    implement LOD
    change render pipeline to URP - which would allow PepLive to run in a browset
  Map Improvements
    Add floor plans to more buildings
    Integrate pathfinding between rooms
